Research Project #4 in the Honours Integrated Science program at McMaster University. The topic is Cancer Science, with a focus on the cell mechanics of semi-resistance to Tasmanian Devil Facial Tumour Disease (DFTD) after treatment with vincristine for our group. RP4-Report.pdf contains the main write-up. The other files are the presentation slides, Python/Jupyter Notebook files for data analysis work, and a short report on the chemistry of how bendamustine treats cancer.
